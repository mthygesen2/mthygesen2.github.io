     <h1>Mao Thygesen<h1>
       <h4>My life in a nutshell</h4>
       <p> <span style="color:#00995c">Hello again!</span> Thanks for wanting to read a little more about me. I was born in Japan and raised there until the young age of 5 and a half. We got up and moved to beautiful Seattle, Washington where I went to school and eventually graduated from University of Washington. I went to school for International Studies and after graduating I got up and moved my life over to Yokosuka, Japan. And since then I have been bitten by the <strong>travel</strong> bug.</p>

       <p>I taught English at an elementary school in Japan for 3 year and aboslutely loved every minute of it. I suddenly decided to uproot my life again and move to Melbourne, Australia. I got a working holiday visa (which I suggest everyone under the age of 30 to go ahead and do) and worked while checking out all the great things Australia has to offer.</p>

       <p>I ended up back in the Pacific Northwest in lovely Portland, Oregon. Close enough to home but far enough where the tranisition back to American living wasn't such a shock. I worked as a bartender at Bamboo Sushi and eventually got myself signed up at <en>Epicodus</em> where I am now.</p>

      <h4>What makes me excited about life</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Food. I enjoy everything about it. Seeing where it comes from, catching it, growing it, cooking/baking it and of course eating it.</li>
          <li>Scuba diving. There is something about seeing the other 70% of the world and singing <em>"Under the Sea"</em> while diving.</li>
          <li>Cats. I swear I am not a crazy cat lady but I think they are awesome. My cats Uni and Ebi are pretty little things. But also my parents dog, Blue. </li>
          <li>Seahawks. I love my boys in green and blue. I have shed tears with them and cheered with them.</li>
          <li>Traveling. If I could, I would never settle and be a nomad for life. Below are the countries I have visited so far but the list just keeps getting longer. </li>
            <ul>
              <li>Mongolia</li>
              <li>Japan</li>
              <li>Cambodia</li>
              <li>Vietnam</li>
              <li>Thailand</li>
              <li>Laos</li>
              <li>South Korea</li>
              <li>China</li>
              <li>Indonesia</li>
              <li>Malaysia</li>
              <li>Iceland</li>
              <li>Turkey</li>
              <li>Hungary</li>
